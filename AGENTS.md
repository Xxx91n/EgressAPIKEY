# ai-api-route - Project Operating Instructions

This document is the single source of truth for the ai-api-route project. All developers, AI agents, and LLMs must follow this specification. When any project feature or structure changes, update this file in the same commit. Detailed references live in `docs/` - keep this file concise; link out instead of inlining large tables.

## context-mode routing (MANDATORY)

- File edits (including patches) MUST go through ctx_batch_execute / ctx_execute_file, not apply_patch.
- ctx_* first; fallback to Codex builtins only when ctx_* can't do the same job. Read-to-analyze / search / large grep: ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries) or ctx_search(queries) - never Get-Content/Select-String into context. For data analysis use ctx_execute(code) and print only the answer.
- Web/HTTP: ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source) then ctx_search(queries). curl/wget/inline HTTP are forbidden.
- Shell OK for git, mkdir, rm, mv, cd, ls, npm install, dotnet build, cargo build, vitest, scripts/build-all.ps1 (execution, not analysis; output is bounded and acceptable).
- Windows paths in ctx sandbox: use bash form /d/Aworker/env-manager/... (lowercase drive, no D:\). PowerShell cmdlets need `pwsh -NoProfile -Command "..."`. `$`-using PowerShell logic must go in a `.ps1` and run with `-File` (inline `$` is stripped by the host transport).
- After resume: `ctx_search(sort:"timeline")` before asking the user anything. Search prior session memory before re-reading sources.
- Output artifacts as files + path + one-line summary; never inline large content. Descriptive source labels for `ctx_search(source:"label")`.
- Keep this block at the very top. Any later agent editing this file must keep the context-mode routing block intact and on top. Extended project spec follows.

## CodeGraph (MANDATORY for code exploration)

CodeGraph is the project's indexed code intelligence layer. The index lives at `.codegraph/` (gitignored). All agents and LLMs working on this project MUST use CodeGraph as the FIRST step for code exploration — it returns verbatim source of relevant symbols grouped by file in one capped call, far more efficient than manual Grep/Read loops.

**How to use**:
- Via MCP: call `codegraph_explore` with `projectPath: "D:\Aworker\env-manager"` and a query (symbol names, file names, or natural-language question).
- Via CLI: `codegraph explore "<query>"` or `codegraph query "<symbol>"` or `codegraph node <symbol>` or `codegraph files`.
- After any code change: run `codegraph sync .` to incrementally update the index. For a full rebuild: `codegraph index .`.
- Check index status: `codegraph status .`.

**When to call FIRST (before reading files)**:
- "How does X work?" or "Where is X defined?"
- "What calls Y?" or "What is the blast radius of changing Z?"
- Surveying an area before an edit
- Finding the call path between symbols

**When NOT needed**: trivial one-file edits where you already know the exact line, or after CodeGraph has already returned the source in this session (treat returned source as already Read — do NOT re-open those files).

**Index sync is mandatory after code changes** (same commit that changes code must update the index). The index is gitignored and never committed.
